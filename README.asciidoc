# Gradle 5 Kotlin-DSL based example build with subprojects and Maven release

NOTE:: This is a work-in-progress

This aims to be an example how to use Gradle 5 and the Kotlin DSL to create a build project which consists of multiple
modules/suprojects which should be published/released as Maven artifacts.

The core design goals are:

* Elegant, clean & simple build with DRY
* Project consisting of multiple, inter-dependent modules
* Release to a Maven repository in quality equal to plain Maven-based build, meaning
** Correct and fully state-of the Art `pom.xml` per artifact
** Including `-source` and `-javadoc` Artifact
